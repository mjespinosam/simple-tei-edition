         <p> This need of movement, 
            this craving for space, 
            among the greater number 
            of plants, is manifested in 
            both the flower and the 
            fruit. It is easily explained 
            in the fruit, or, in any case, 
            discloses only a less complex 
            experience and foresight. 
            Contrary to that which 
            takes place in the animal 
            kingdom and because of the 
            terrible law of absolute im- 
            mobility, the chief and 
            worst enemy of the seed is 
            the paternal stock. 
            We are in a strange world, where 
            the parents, unable to move 
            from place to place, know 
            that they are condemned to 
            starve or stifle their off- 
            spring. Every seed that 
            falls at the joot of tEeTtree 
            or plant is either lost or 
            doomed to sprout in wretch- ( 
            edness . Hence the immense 
            effort to throw off the yoke 
            and conquer space. Hence 
            the marvellous systems of 
            dissemination, of propul- 
            sion, of navigation of the 
            air which we find on every 
            side in the forest and the 
            plain: among others, to 
            mention, in passing, but a 
            few of the most curious, 
            the aerial screw or samara of 
            the Maple; the bract of 
            the Lime-tree; the flying- 
            machine of the Thistle, the 
            Dandelion and the Salsafy ; 
            the detonating springs of 
            the Spurge ; the extraordi- 
            nary squirt of the Momor- 
            dica ; the hooks of the 
            eriophilous plants ; and a 
            thousand other unexpected 
            and astounding pieces of 
            mechanism ; for there is 
            not, so to speak, a single 
            seed but has invented for 
            its sole use a complete 
            method of escaping from 
            the maternal shade. </p>
